# Demonstration of jupyter + voila for code executation

This demonstrates using jupyter +
[voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/) +
[binder](https://mybinder.org/) to run some Python code on an
arbitrary input dataset, with some basic interaction.  This can easily
be extended to other methods.

To start, click on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rkdarst/voila-demo-kmeans/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fkmeans.ipynb)

The backend is a Jupyter notebook, and the frontend is also Jupyter,
but through the "voila" interface, which hides everything except for
the output, allowing the only input to be through IPython widgets.
